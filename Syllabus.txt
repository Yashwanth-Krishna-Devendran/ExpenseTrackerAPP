The file contains the syllabus for a B.Tech AI & DS course titled "Object-Oriented Programming" (CS2003). 
Here's an outline based on the main topics covered:

1. Introduction to OOP and Java Fundamentals
   - Key concepts: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
   - Java basics: Characteristics, environment setup, source file structure, compilation
   - Core programming structures: Classes, constructors, methods, access specifiers, static members, control flow, arrays, packages, JavaDoc comments "Use all these features to develop the application which i mentioned above" 

2. Inheritance and Interfaces
   - Topics: Super and sub-classes, protected members, constructors in subclasses, abstract classes, final methods and classes
   - Interfaces: Definition, implementation, differences from classes, extensions
   - Additional concepts: Object cloning, inner classes, Array Lists, Strings

3. Exception Handling and I/O
   - Exception hierarchy, custom exceptions, stack trace elements
   - I/O: Basics, streams (byte and character), console and file read/write operations

4. Multithreading and Generic Programming
   - Threading: Life cycle, creation, synchronization, inter-thread communication, daemon threads, thread groups
   - Generic programming: Generic classes/methods, bounded types, restrictions

5. Event-Driven Programming
   - Graphics programming: Frames, components, 2D shapes, colors, fonts, images
   - Event handling basics, AWT event hierarchy, Swing components (Text fields, Buttons, Dialog boxes, etc.)
